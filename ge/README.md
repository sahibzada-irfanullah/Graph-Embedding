## How to utilize a code? (Tutorial)

```
#### input graph
my_graph = Your input graph goes here
```

Where
- Khop: required khop number
- path/inputgraph: hdfs path to the input graph
- path/khop: hdfs path to the output

# Output:
After running the code successfully, all the generated khops will be stored in "/khop" on hdfs as:
